  Letâ€™s walk through the Redis source code and observe how the PING command is implemented.

  Redis is an open-source in-memory data store. It exposes a set of commands for managing and working with data, like
  [`GET`][redis-get-command] and [`SET`][redis-set-command]. In this walkthrough, we'll look at how the [`PING`][redis-ping-command]
  command is implemented in the Redis source code.
