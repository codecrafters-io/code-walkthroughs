title: How Redis binds to a port

description_markdown: |
  Letâ€™s walk through the Redis source code and observe how a Redis server binds to a port as part of the boot process.

  Redis is an open-source in-memory data store. It exposes a set of commands for managing and working with data, like
  [`GET`][redis-get-command] and [`SET`][redis-set-command]. In this walkthrough, we'll dive into Redis's source code
  and look at how a Redis server binds to a port as part of the boot process.
