title: How the Redis event loop is implemented

description_markdown: |
  Letâ€™s walk through the Redis source code and observe how the event loop is implemented.

introduction_markdown: |
  Redis is an open-source in-memory data store that can support thousands of concurrent clients and serve
  [over 1 million requests per second][redis-perf-faq] on an average Linux system.  way Redis does this is by using
  an [event loop][wikipedia-event-loop] (similar to [JavaScript's event loop][javascript-event-loop]). In this 
  walkthrough, we'll look at how the event loop is implemented in the Redis source code.
